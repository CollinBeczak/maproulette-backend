# MapRoulette Version 2
Version 2 of Map Roulette

Click [here](docs/api.md) for API documentation.

Welcome to MapRoulette version 2, the powerful & popular bug fixing tool (or is it a game?) for OpenStreetMap.

This README deals with development related topics only. If you are interested in contributing to OpenStreetMap by fixing some bugs through MapRoulette, just head over to [the MapRoulette web site](http://maproulette.org) and get started - it should be pretty self explanatory.

That said, read on if you want to contribute to MapRoulette development and are ready to deploy your local instance.

## Contributing

Please fork the project and submit pull requests on the `develop` branch.

See the code style conventions at https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette/wiki/Code-style-conventions

### Frameworks used

MapRoulette version 2 is built upon the Play Framework using Scala. You can find more information about the Play Framework at https://www.playframework.com

* Play Framework 2.5.0 with Scala 2.11.7
