Welcome to New MapRoulette, the powerful & popular bug fixing tool (or is it a game?) for OpenStreetMap.

This README deals with development related topics only. If you are interested in contributing to OpenStreetMap by fixing some bugs through MapRoulette, just head over to [the MapRoulette web site](http://maproulette.org) and get started - it should be pretty self explanatory.

That said, read on if you want to contribute to MapRoulette development and are ready to deploy your local instance.

## Contributing

Please fork the project and submit a pull request.
