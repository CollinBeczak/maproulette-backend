# Testing MapRoulette 2 API with Postman

MapRoulette 2 can be easily tested using Postman with the [Collection File](maproulette2.postman_collection). To test the API execute the following:

1. Download Postman if you don't already have it [here](https://www.getpostman.com/)
2. Open Postman and import the [MapRoulette 2 Collection file](maproulette2.postman_collection)
3. Open the Postman runner.
4. Run tests for collection folders Project, Challenge and Tag.

This will run through a variety of API calls and verify that the calls come back as expected.
